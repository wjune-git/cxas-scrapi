# Agent Foundry

End-to-end lifecycle for GECX conversational agents: build, test, debug, iterate.

## Step tracking — MANDATORY (Phase 0, blocking)

**Before doing ANY work — including running setup, asking questions, or scaffolding files — initialize `<project>/todo.md` from the relevant sub-skill's checklist (verbatim).** The checklist is a contract, not a suggestion. If `todo.md` doesn't exist for the current task, refuse to proceed and create it first.

Long debug/build runs skip verification steps under pressure (e.g., pushing without linting, scaffolding without a TDD, claiming "deployed" without actually pushing). The checklist exists because of this. **The instinct to skip a step is the moment the checklist earns its keep — that's when you must consult it, not the moment to bypass it.**


## Quick Reference

```bash
# Lint: dispatch agents/lint-fixer.md sub-agent — DO NOT run `cxas lint` on the main thread.
# Lint output is verbose; keep it inside the sub-agent context.

# Push local files to platform (only after lint-fixer returns status: clean)
cxas push --app-dir <project>/cxas_app/<AppName> \
  --to projects/<project_id>/locations/<location>/apps/<app_id> \
  --project-id <project_id> --location <location>

# Pull platform state to local
cxas pull projects/<project_id>/locations/<location>/apps/<app_id> \
  --project-id <project_id> --location <location> --target-dir <project>/cxas_app/

# Run evals + triage + report (single command)
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/run-and-report.py --message "what changed" --runs 5

# Inspect app architecture
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/inspect-app.py

# Triage failures
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/triage-results.py --last 3

# Run all 6 build-verification gates against the deployed app
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/gate-check.py

# Tune scoring thresholds (similarity, hallucination, extra-tools)
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/app-thresholds.py show

# Sync callback Python code into evals/callback_tests/agents/ + create test.py symlinks.
# Required for tests to be discoverable by test_all_callbacks_in_app_dir.
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/sync-callbacks.py                  # post-push: pull from platform
python .agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/sync-callbacks.py --from-local <app_dir>  # pre-push: copy from local app dir

# Cold-start setup (first-time only — venv + project bootstrap)
.agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/setup.sh
```

**Disambiguation:** `gate-check.py` and `inspect-app.py` overlap on "show me the architecture" but `gate-check.py` is the answer whenever the user is about to push, finished building, or wants a verification pass. `inspect-app.py` is for a quick "what's in here" look without the verification gates. When in doubt, use `gate-check.py`.

## Sub-agents

For heavy diagnosis/analysis work that would otherwise burn main-thread context, dispatch one of these sub-agents via the `Agent` tool. Pass the contents of the relevant `.md` file as the prompt, then add the inputs the file lists.

| Sub-agent | Reasoning intensity | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/triage-failure.md` | HIGH | Diagnose ONE failing eval. Fan out for the top 5 failures by category priority in parallel. Iterate on more after the first batch returns. |
| `agents/tdd-writer.md` | HIGH | Reverse-engineer a TDD from an existing agent OR draft from PRD. Returns the TDD + open-questions handoff; main thread runs the show/ask/iterate loop with the user (sub-agents can't ask). |
| `agents/scaffolder.md` | MEDIUM | Bulk-generate all agent code (agent JSONs, instruction.txt, tool python_code, callbacks, app.json) from an APPROVED TDD. One dispatch replaces 30-60 main-thread file writes. |
| `agents/coverage-analyst.md` | MEDIUM | Generate a full eval coverage report against an agent's architecture. |
| `agents/eval-writer.md` | MEDIUM | Generate evals for one entire eval TYPE (all goldens, all sims, etc.) — reads TDD's Coverage Map itself. Max 4 dispatches per build. |
| `agents/lint-fixer.md` | LOW (mechanical) | Run `cxas lint` and mechanically fix all errors + deterministic warnings until clean. Never run lint on main thread. |

For running evals: there is no sub-agent. Use `scripts/run-and-report.py --json-summary <path> > /dev/null 2>&1` and read the summary file — see `references/debug.md` → "Quick Start". The work was deterministic, so it lives in the script.

**Reasoning intensity** is a hint to the runtime: HIGH sub-agents benefit from more thinking budget / a stronger model, LOW sub-agents are recipe-driven and don't. Each sub-agent file repeats this hint at the top with a one-line justification.

## Environment Readiness Check (run BEFORE routing)

Before routing to any sub-skill, check these signals in order:

1. **Virtualenv exists?** -- Check if `.venv/` directory exists
2. **Config exists?** -- Check if `.scrapi/active-project` file exists and the referenced `<project>/gecx-config.toml` exists
3. **Has built before?** -- Check if any `<project>/cxas_app/` directory has content

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| No `.venv/` or no config | **First-time setup needed.** Load `references/setup.md` before doing anything else. |
| `gecx-config.toml` exists but no `cxas_app/` content | Returning user, new project. Route normally. |
| All exist | Returning user. Route normally. |

## Detect Intent and Route

Read what the user wants and load the appropriate sub-skill:

| User says... | Phase | Load |
|-------------|-------|------|
| "Build me an agent from this PRD" | Build | `references/build.md` |
| **"Create a new cxas app", "Make a new agent", "Set up an agent", "I wanna build an agent"** | **Build** | **`references/build.md`** |
| "Create evals for my agent" | Build | `references/build.md` |
| "Generate tool tests", "create callback tests" | Build | `references/build.md` |
| "Update evals -- requirements changed" | Build | `references/build.md` |
| "Update the TDD" | Build | `references/build.md` |
| "Run evals", "push evals", "check results" | Run | `references/run.md` |
| "Run tool tests", "test the callbacks" | Run | `references/run.md` |
| "Generate a report" | Run | `references/run.md` |
| "Why is this eval failing", "get to 90%" | Debug | `references/debug.md` |
| "Fix the failing evals", "debug the agent" | Debug | `references/debug.md` |
| "Tool test is failing", "callback test broke" | Debug | `references/debug.md` |
| **"Edit the agent's instructions", "tweak the auth tool", "fix the greeting", "update this callback"** | **Build** (Edit cycle) | **`references/build.md` → "Editing an Existing Agent"** |

**Any phrasing that implies creating, building, or setting up an agent/app routes to `references/build.md` — even if it sounds like "just create the app shell."** "Create a new cxas app" is NOT a shortcut to scaffolding; it triggers the full build flow (todo.md → interview/PRD → TDD + approval → scaffold → lint → evals → push). Skipping the interview / TDD because the user said "create" instead of "build" is a routing failure.

**Editing an existing agent** (instruction tweak, tool change, callback fix) routes to build.md's "Editing an Existing Agent" section — the standard pull → edit → lint → push → run-evals cycle. Don't skip lint or the eval run after — silent regressions are how 90% rates drop to 70%.

If the intent is unclear, ask: "Are you looking to **build/create** evals, **run** them, or **debug** failures?"

## Before Starting

Check memory for project-specific context (app ID, variable handling rules, audio scoring workarounds). If not available, ask the user.
