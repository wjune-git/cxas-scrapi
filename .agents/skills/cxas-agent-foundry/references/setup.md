# Onboarding Flow & Configuration

## Onboarding Flow (first-time users only)

When the readiness check identifies a first-time user (no `.venv/`):

1. **Create virtualenv and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   Then find `cxas-scrapi` source (look for `setup.py` containing `cxas-scrapi` in parent directories or siblings) and install:
   ```bash
   pip install -e <path_to_cxas_scrapi> --quiet
   ```
2. **Collect project details** -- see Configuration below.
3. Confirm with the user: "Your environment is set up. You're connected to **[app_name]** on **[project_id]**."
4. If the user's original request was "build me an agent" -> proceed to the build sub-skill. If they connected to an existing app -> ask: "Do you want to create evals for this existing agent, or build something new?" Otherwise -> proceed with their original request.

## Configuration

Ask for details **one at a time** -- don't batch all questions into a single message. Start with whichever the user hasn't provided yet, wait for the answer, then ask the next. If the user provides multiple details upfront (e.g., "project is foo, voice agent"), skip the questions they already answered.

### New agent (building from scratch)

1. **GCP Project ID** -- which GCP project to use
2. **App name** -- display name for the agent app (also used as app ID)
3. **Modality** -- `audio` (voice agent) or `text` (chat agent)
4. **GCS bucket** (audio only) -- ONLY ask if modality is `audio`. Format: `gs://<bucket-name>`. Required for audio because the platform's `evaluationAudioRecordingConfig` needs a bucket to record/store audio eval artifacts; without it, every audio eval run returns HTTP 400. Skip this question entirely for text agents.

Everything else is derived:
- **Location**: defaults to `us`
- **Model**: `gemini-3.1-flash-live` for audio, `gemini-3-flash` for text
- **deployed_app_id**: `null` for new apps (set after first push)

Once you have all answers, write `<project_name>/gecx-config.toml` inside the project folder (NOT at the repo root) in TOML format:
```toml
gcp-project-id = "<project>"
location = "us"
app-name = "<app_name>"
app-dir = "cxas_app/"
model = "<model_based_on_modality>"
modality = "<audio_or_text>"
default-channel = "<audio_or_text>"
gcs-path = "<gs://bucket-name>"
```

Omit the `gcs-path` field entirely for text agents (don't write empty — leave it out).

### Existing agent (connecting to an app that already exists)

1. **GCP Project ID** -- which GCP project to use
2. **App ID** -- the deployed app ID (short name or UUID)

Once you have both, run the workspace setup command to create a new workspace, pull the app, and auto-detect modality:
```bash
cxas workspace create <project_name> \
  --project-id <gcp_project> \
  --app-id <app_id>
```

The command pulls the app, reads `app.json` to detect the model and modality, writes `gecx-config.toml`, and sets the active workspace. No need to ask for modality -- it's auto-detected from the deployed app.

Note: For `app_id`, use the **short name** (e.g., `my-app-id`), NOT the full Google Cloud resource path. The SDK handles the pathing automatically.
