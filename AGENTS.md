.venv/                          # Shared virtual environment
AGENTS.md                       # Workspace overview (this file)
.active-project                 # (Optional) Points to the currently active project folder
```

## Setup

Run the setup script to create a virtual environment and install the `cxas-scrapi` SDK from the local source:

```bash
.agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/setup.sh          # Full setup (install + configure)
.agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/scripts/setup.sh --configure  # Reconfigure only
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Requires Python 3.10+ and [astral-uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Available Skills

This workspace provides several specialized AI skills to assist with development. 

- **`cxas-agent-foundry`**: The primary skill for the end-to-end GECX agent lifecycle. Use this for building agents from PRDs, generating and running evals, debugging failures, and syncing code.
- **`cxas-sim-eval`**: A utility skill for converting CXAS golden evaluations to SCRAPI SimulationEvals test cases.
- **`llm-lint`**: An AI-driven semantic linter for GECX sub-agent instructions. It reviews natural language rules and style guidelines using Gemini for a single sub-agent at a time.

*Note: For detailed development workflows, linter policies, and GECX-specific conventions, refer to the documentation within the respective skills (e.g., `.agents/skills/cxas-agent-foundry/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/llm-lint/SKILL.md`).*
